# 30-Days-Of-Coding
Code something for 30 days. Beginner Java/HTML/CSS/JS/Python projects to get started. 

The purpose is to strengthen on coding basics, and build up to an advanced project.
I will also keep myself accountable for everyday to ensure I code everyday and learn something new everyday.
